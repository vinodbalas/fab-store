# Component Library Expansion

This file contains the expanded component library structure that needs to be integrated into AppBuilder.jsx.

The new structure replaces the single "ui" category with multiple organized categories:
- form-controls
- data-display
- charts-graphs
- navigation
- feedback
- advanced

See the full component definitions in the search_replace operations below.
