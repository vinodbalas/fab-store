SECTION 3: PAPER JAM RESOLUTION
================================================================================

SYMPTOMS:
- Paper jam error message on printer display
- Paper stuck in paper path
- Multiple paper jam errors in succession
- Printer stops mid-print with jam indication

ROOT CAUSES:
1. Foreign objects in paper path
2. Worn or damaged paper rollers
3. Incorrect paper type or size loaded
4. Paper path obstruction from previous jam
5. Paper sensor malfunction

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:

Step 1: Power Off and Clear Paper Path
- Turn off printer immediately
- Unplug power cord (wait 30 seconds)
- Open all access panels (front, rear, top)
- Remove paper trays
- Gently pull out any visible paper (pull in direction of paper flow, never force)
- Check for torn paper fragments

Step 2: Inspect Paper Path
- Use flashlight to inspect entire paper path
- Look for small paper fragments, labels, or foreign objects
- Check rollers for damage or debris
- Verify paper guides are properly aligned
- Clean any visible debris with lint-free cloth

Step 3: Clean Paper Sensors
- Locate paper sensors (usually near paper path entry/exit points)
- Use compressed air to blow out sensor areas
- Gently clean sensor with cotton swab and isopropyl alcohol
- Allow sensors to dry completely before testing

Step 4: Verify Paper Loading
- Use only recommended paper types (check printer manual)
- Ensure paper is not wrinkled, curled, or damaged
- Do not exceed maximum paper capacity
- Align paper stack properly in tray
- Adjust paper guides to match paper width

Step 5: Test with Different Paper
- Try printing with different paper type/brand
- Use plain white paper for testing
- Verify paper size matches printer settings
- Check paper weight is within specifications

AUTOMATED RESOLUTION:
- Script: clear-paper-jam.ps1
- Command: Reset-PrinterPaperPath
- Verification: Run printer self-test page

PREVENTION:
- Use high-quality paper
- Store paper in dry, flat location
