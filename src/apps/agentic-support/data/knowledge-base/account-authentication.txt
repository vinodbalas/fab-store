  * Lowercase letters required
  * Numbers required
  * Special characters required
  * Cannot match previous passwords
- Ensure new password meets all requirements
- Try different password that meets criteria

Step 4: Unlock Account

- Contact IT support to manually unlock account
- Verify account status in user management portal
- Check if account is disabled or suspended
- Review account lockout policy settings

Step 5: Alternative Reset Methods

- Ensure time zone is set correctly
- Sync device time with internet time server
- Restart authenticator app after time sync
- Verify authenticator app time matches system time

Step 2: Check Code Entry
- Enter code immediately after generation (codes expire quickly)
- Verify no extra spaces before/after code
- Check if code is 6 or 8 digits as required
- Try next code if current one expired
- Wait for new code generation if needed

Step 3: Reconfigure Authenticator App
- Remove account from authenticator app
- Re-add account using QR code or setup key
- Verify account name matches in app
- Test code generation after reconfiguration
- Save backup codes in secure location

Step 4: Use Backup Codes
- Locate backup codes (saved during MFA setup)
- Enter backup code when prompted
- Use each backup code only once
- Generate new backup codes after using one
- Store backup codes securely

Step 5: Disable and Re-enable MFA
- Contact IT support to temporarily disable MFA
- Set up MFA again with new device
- Scan QR code or enter setup key
- Verify MFA works before closing support ticket
- Update MFA device in account settings

AUTOMATED RESOLUTION:
- Script: reset-mfa.ps1
- Command: Reset-MFADevice -Username "user@company.com"
- Verification: Test-MFAStatus

SECTION 3: SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) FAILURES
================================================================================

SYMPTOMS:
- SSO login redirects to error page
- "SSO authentication failed" message
- Infinite redirect loop

- Clear browser cache completely
- Close all browser windows
- Restart browser and retry SSO login

Step 3: Try Different Browser
- Test SSO in different browser
- Verify SSO works in alternative browser
- If works, issue is browser-specific
- Update or reinstall problematic browser
- Check browser extensions blocking SSO

Step 4: Verify Application SSO Configuration
- Check application is SSO-enabled
- Verify application appears in SSO portal
- Review application SSO settings
- Contact application administrator
- Check application logs for SSO errors

Step 5: Check Network and Firewall
- Verify network connectivity to SSO provider
- Check firewall allows SSO traffic
- Test SSO from different network
